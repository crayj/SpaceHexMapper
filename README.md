# SpaceHexMapper
This is going to be a project to get a basic interactable hexagonal map up and running.

Specifically for space some space game that we're working with, though would be cool to get this thing pretty generic if other people would want to use it for tabletop RPGs or something.

# Map Types
1. Universe Map
2. Player Map - Local System
This will be a small subset of the world map and will show details of each hex.
A hex can be the following
Planet - Ice, Rock, Gas
Asteroids 
Star or other star configuration (Binary star system for example)
Wormhole

# Planets
* HP which will range from 3-9 and also has the greatest affect on resource availability
* Population score 0-9 has a minor affect on resource availability

# Local System
It appears that one of each object appears in each local system in additon to whatever designated starting planet a race had
* 1 planet of a users choosing - rock | ice | gas
* 1 of each planet - rock, ice, gas
* 1 asteroid cluster
* 1 wormhole
* 1 star at the center of the local system
